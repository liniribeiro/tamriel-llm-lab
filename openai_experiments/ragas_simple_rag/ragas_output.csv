What is the theory of evolution by natural selection?,"[""Charles Darwin introduced the theory of evolution by natural selection in his book 'On the Origin of Species'.""]","The theory of evolution by natural selection, introduced by Charles Darwin in his book *On the Origin of Species*, explains how species evolve over time. It suggests that individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over generations, these advantageous traits become more common in the population, leading to gradual changes and the evolution of species.",Charles Darwin introduced the theory of evolution by natural selection in his book 'On the Origin of Species'.,1.0,0.2,0.89
